## Introduction

[ExtCore](https://github.com/ExtCore/ExtCore) is free, open source and cross-platform framework for creating
modular and extendable web applications based on ASP.NET Core. It is built using the best and the most modern
tools and languages (Visual Studio 2019, C# etc). Join our team!

This is the ExtCore framework advanced sample accounting web application:

It contains 4 extensions: barebone (defines the generic system UI etc.), incomes, expenses, and balance.
It uses SQLite database to store all the information. UI is built from the parts too.

## Getting Started

* rebuild the solution;
* copy the extensions DLL files into the Extensions folder of the main web application (this folder doesnâ€™t exist by default,
so you need to create it in the web application root or specify another location in the config.json file; also you may just
add direct dependencies to the main web application project instead, but it is not so interesting);
* run the main web application.
